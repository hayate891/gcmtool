There are now 2 executables in this package:
	gcmtool:	for working with GameCube DVD images
	gcmbnrtool:	for working with .bnr files (ie: opening.bnr)

See execute either program with -? to see a list of commandline options 
and their explanations. I'll create a more robust readme for the next 
release.

I've also got to put some stuff up on the site.
