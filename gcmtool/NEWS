2004/7/4 (0.3.0)
There are now 5 executables in this package:
	gcmtool
	gcmbnrtool
	gcmdiskheadertool
	gcmdiskheaderinfotool
	gcmapploadertool

This release is primarily for bugfixes, optimizations and more robust programs.
There's still a lot to do, but that'll all wait for a later release. Check out
the website for more information and news (http://gcmtool.sf.net)

gcmdiskheadertool, gcmdiskheaderinfotool, and gcmapploadertool are, for the most 
part, useless right now, except for the fact that it dumps the full info for 
a GCM's diskheader. The next release should add editing features and other 
fun things.

There are now 2 executables in this package:
	gcmtool:	for working with GameCube DVD images
	gcmbnrtool:	for working with .bnr files (ie: opening.bnr)

See execute either program with -? to see a list of commandline options 
and their explanations. I'll create a more robust readme for the next 
release.

I've also got to put some stuff up on the site.
