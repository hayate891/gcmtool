GCMTools Suite
http://gcmtool.sourceforge.net

The GCMTools are a suite of tools to basically rip apart your gamecube games
and put them back together however you wish. Its aim is to give you access to
everything so you can modify and hack your games to your wildest dreams.

Currently, there are 5 executables that are part of this package:

	gcmtool- for auditing, extracting and editing Nintendo GameCube DVD images 
		(.iso or .gcm).

	gcmdiskheadertool- once you've extracted the disk header, this tool lets
		you modify it.

	gcmdiskheaderinfotool- for modifying the diskheaderinfo

	gcmapploadertool- currently only allows you to view info about the apploader
		when there is a better understanding of the apploader, I'll give access
		to editing features. For now, you have to use a hex editor.

	gcmbnrtool- allows modification of the opening.bnr file found in all
		gamecube games. This tool allows you to extract the icon file of a game
		either as a photoshop .raw or a .ppm for conversion to other formats.
		Unfortunately, I'm having trouble getting the ppm import working, so
		you'll have to use a hex editor to delete the ppm header if you want
		to re-inject an icon.

WHEN MODIFYING YOUR GCM, ALWAYS WORK ON A BACKUP COPY!

Thanks to gc-linux.org's YAGCD for all of the information it contained. 
I wouldn't have been able to do this project without it.

Also Mr. Spiv for porting doltool to OSX so I could check my work in my 
own code against something.

Better documentation is available online on the webstie at the top of this
document.
