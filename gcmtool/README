gcmtool
http://gcmtool.sourceforge.net

gcmtool is a tool for auditing and editing Nintendo GameCube DVD images 
(.iso or .gcm). Currently (5/26/2004), most of the code is there to do 
whatever the hell you want, but the commandline implementation has yet 
to be written.

Thanks to gc-linux.org's YAGCD for all of the information it contained. 
I wouldn't have been able to do this project without it.

Also Mr. Spiv for porting doltool to OSX so I could check my work in my 
own code against something.

Documentation must be put together as well.
